This project was a redesign done for an online architecture school, which offers a collection of online courses through the *Canvas Platform*.
*Canvas* is a Learning Management System that offers very little customization flexibility, so the challenge was to do a re-design of the course h omepage that stood within the *Canvas* boundaries and at the same time improved significantly the user experience.
